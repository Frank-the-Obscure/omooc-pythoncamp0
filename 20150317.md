##Git at OS 10.10.3

Something goes wrong with Git app for Mac. So trying to make it directly at terminal.

1. setting up git
	1. resources: [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) 
	2. [code school](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project)

2. pushing

	something wrong with git's command for GitHub pushing (may becausing it's another setting), so deciding to find some other ways in code school.

	git push -u origin master

	this line works for me well!
