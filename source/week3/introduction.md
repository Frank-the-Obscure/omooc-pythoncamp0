# Week 3

Copyright [Frank Hu](https://github.com/Frank-the-Obscure), 2015

- Objectives:
  - `Just write enough python codes!` (just write with uncertainty & iteration)
    - 整体考量: 
      - 前两周环境和基本语法知识已有,但后者不扎实,需要提高;
      - 自己按部就班学习有盲目感;
      - 代码是手艺活,不如直接选择多写代码?
	- Learn in use (then write book)
	  - 这样结合了在使用中学习和教别人两大学习科学的大招,也许比较靠谱?
  - Maybe 500+ lines this week?
  - Note 
  - One thing at a time
    - So don't optimize environment/git/gitbook etc. in this week (only when these problem appears more than 3 times)
  - Finish project and more quizzes
    - Project
      - Code on paper
      - Write v1.0
      - Iteration and iteration
